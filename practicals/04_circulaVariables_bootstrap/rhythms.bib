(8–12 Hz) oscillations, which fluctuate with both sustained and directed
attention, represent a pulsed inhibition of ongoing sensory brain activity.
Here we tested the prediction that inhibitory alpha oscillations in visual
cortex are modulated by top–down signals from frontoparietal attention
networks. We measured modulations in phase-coherent alpha oscillations from
superficial frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices using the event-related
optical signal (EROS), a measure of neuronal activity affording high
spatiotemporal resolution, along with concurrently recorded EEG, while
participants performed a visual target detection task. The pretarget alpha
oscillations measured with EEG and EROS from posterior areas were larger for
subsequently undetected targets, supporting alpha's inhibitory role. Using
EROS, we localized brain correlates of these awareness-related alpha
oscillations measured at the scalp to the cuneus and precuneus. Crucially, EROS
alpha suppression correlated with posterior EEG alpha power across
participants. Sorting the EROS data based on EEG alpha power quartiles to
investigate alpha modulators revealed that suppression of posterior alpha was
preceded by increased activity in regions of the dorsal attention network and
decreased activity in regions of the cingulo-opercular network.
Cross-correlations revealed the temporal dynamics of activity within these
preparatory networks before posterior alpha modulation. The novel combination
of EEG and EROS afforded localization of the sources and correlates of alpha
oscillations and their temporal relationships, supporting our proposal that
top–down control from attention networks modulates both posterior alpha and
awareness of visual stimuli.}

  abstract={

Rhythmic events are common in our sensory world. Temporal regularities could be
used to predict the timing of upcoming events, thus facilitating their
processing. Indeed, cognitive theories have long posited the existence of
internal oscillators whose timing can be entrained to ongoing periodic stimuli
in the environment as a mechanism of temporal attention. Recently, recordings
from primate brains have shown electrophysiological evidence for these
hypothesized internal oscillations. We hypothesized that rhythmic visual
stimuli can entrain ongoing neural oscillations in humans, locking the timing
of the excitability cycles they represent and thus enhancing processing of
subsequently predictable stimuli. Here we report evidence for entrainment of
neural oscillations by predictable periodic stimuli in the alpha frequency band
and show for the first time that the phase of existing brain oscillations
cannot only be modified in response to rhythmic visual stimulation but that the
resulting phase-locked fluctuations in excitability lead to concomitant
fluctuations in visual awareness in humans. This entrainment effect was
dependent on both the amount of spontaneous alpha power before the experiment
and the level of 12-Hz oscillation before each trial and could not be explained
by evoked activity. Rhythmic fluctuations in awareness elicited by entrainment
of ongoing neural excitability cycles support a proposed role for alpha
oscillations as a pulsed inhibition of cortical activity. Furthermore, these
data provide evidence for the quantized nature of our conscious experience and
reveal a powerful mechanism by which temporal attention as well as perceptual
snapshots can be manipulated and controlled.

    note={

The experiment is as in mathewson et al. 2010. A sequence of eight anuli
(entrainers) were presented rhytmically (period 83ms). Then at different
delays a target was presented. The main finding of the article is a
correlation between the amount of ITC (in a 200ms window after the presentation
of the last entrainer) and target detectability (Figure 4a and 4d), as well as
the correlation between alpha power and target detectability (Figure 6).

Fig 1 shows the stimuli presentation scheme. 

Fig 2 shows the behavioral results. As in Mathewson et al. 2010 higher tharget
detection rate occurs at the delay corresponding to the time of presentation
of the next entrainer (83ms). We also see a second weaker peak in the target
detection rate at two times the time of presentation of thte next entrainer
(177ms). This second weaker peak could be interpreted as evidence for a
foreperiod effect.

Fig 3 shows ERP reults. The first entrainers triggers a strong ERP. The
reminder entrainers trigger much weaker ERPs.

Fig 4a is the main figure of the article. It shows that in the 200ms after the
last entrainer there is a significant difference in the ITC of the rhythmic
condition wrt the ITC of the variable condition. For the rhythmic condition
the amount if ITC after the pretarget period was significantly correlated with
average detection rate.

Fig 4d shows that there is a significant difference in ITC between the low-
minuse the high-variability condition in two time-frequency windows, one
around 12Hz and the other one around 17Hz. Importantly, the difference in ITC
between the high- and low-variability condition is significantly correlated
with the difference in detection of targets at 83ms between the low- and
high-variablity conditions.

Fig 5a shows the phase of single trials at the time of target onset for
in-phase and out-of-phase targets in the rhythmic condition. The average phase
of the in-phase and out-of-phase targets differed signficantly. Also, the
difference in average phase between in-phase and out-of-phase targers for
subjects (Fig 5a, bottom panels) was correlated with the difference in
detection errors between in-phase and out-of-phase trials. Fig 5b is as Fig 5a
but for the variable condition. Here the average phase of the in-phase and
out-of-phase trials was also significantly different, but the difference in
average phase between in-phase and out-of-phase targers for
subjects (Fig 5b, bottom panels) was NOT correlated with the difference in
detection errors between in-phase and out-of-phase trials.

Fig 5c (top panels) plots phases at 12Hz and 100ms before the target onset for
detected and undetected targets in the rhythmic condition. There was a
significant difference in the mean phases of these trials. Fig 5d is as Fig 5c
but for the variable condition. Here there was also a significant difference
in the mean phases of these trials.

Fig 6 plots detection performance versus lag after the last entrainer for
trials with low alpha power 200ms before fixation onset (before the start of a
trial, left panel) and for trials with high alpha power (right panel). In the
rhytmic condition at 83ms after the last entrainer the detection performance
is larger for trials beginning with high power. Not shown in the figure, but
discussed in the manuscript, is that participants with more resting alpha
power (alpha power before the start of the experiment) had larger differences
in detection between in-phase and out-of-phase target in the rhythmic and
variable conditions.

Alpha oscillations are ubiquitous in the brain, but their role in
cortical processing remains a matter of debate. Recently, evidence has begun to
accumulate in support of a role for alpha oscillations in attention selection
and control. Here we first review evidence that 8-12 Hz oscillations in the
brain have a general inhibitory role in cognitive processing, with an emphasis
on their role in visual processing. Then, we summarize the evidence in support
of our recent proposal that alpha represents a pulsed-inhibition of ongoing
neural activity. The phase of the ongoing electroencephalography can influence
evoked activity and subsequent processing, and we propose that alpha exerts its
inhibitory role through alternating microstates of inhibition and excitation.
Finally, we discuss evidence that this pulsed-inhibition can be entrained to
rhythmic stimuli in the environment, such that preferential processing occurs
for stimuli at predictable moments. The entrainment of preferential phase may
provide a mechanism for temporal attention in the brain. This pulsed inhibitory
account of alpha has important implications for many common cognitive
phenomena, such as the attentional blink, and seems to indicate that our visual
experience may at least some times be coming through in waves.

cortical activation levels in a metacontrast masking paradigm. When a visual
target presentation coincides with the trough of an alpha wave, cortical
activation is suppressed as early as 100 ms after stimulus onset, and observers
are less likely to detect the target. Thus, during one alpha cycle lasting 100
ms, the human brain goes through a rapid oscillation in excitability, which
directly influences the probability that an environmental stimulus will reach
conscious awareness. Moreover, ERPs to the appearance of a fixation cross
before the target predict its detection, further suggesting that cortical
excitability level may mediate target detection. A novel theory of cortical
inhibition is proposed in which increased alpha power represents a "pulsed
inhibition" of cortical activity that affects visual awareness.},

    NOTE = {The main idea of the paper is illustrated in Figure 1.
Synchronized alpha oscillations do not reflect an iddle brain, but a
top-down inhibitory control. This inhibitory control over a set of neurons
makes these cells fire in a narrower time window and activate their common
target neurons with a larger temporal synchrony, and therefore more
effectively. ERD is related reflects information processing in the sense of
excitation, while ERS reflect inhibition for selective brain processing.
Let us briefly reconsider three examples, we already have discussed. (i)
The increase in alpha activity during retention in memory tasks (cf.
Section 3.2.1) can be interpreted in terms of top-down control on stored
information by inhibiting retrieval of interfering information. (ii) ERS in
motor tasks may again be interpreted as top-down control on stored motor
information to inhibit retrieval of learned responses (e.g., Hummel et al.,
2002) or to inhibit access to potentially interfering motor memory traces
during imagery (e.g., Neuper et al., 1999). (iii) The general finding that
brain areas not involved in the performance of a task exhibit ERS (in motor
but also in complex cognitive tasks) can also be interpreted as manifesta
tion of top-down control to keep processing focused on task- relevant
areas. Internal control of attention is associated with an increase in
alpha activity. In memory processes ERS is observed during access to the
memory trace, but ERD when the trace is retrieved. Increased in alpha
relates to decreasing metabolic rate, suggesting an inhibitory effect of
synchronized alpha. The article provides references supporting the
hypothesis that the cortex exhibits cyclic cahnges between maximal and
minimal responsiveness that are related to the negative and positive phase
of alpha. An increas in alpha coherence could be related to early semantic
encoding of objects. This alpha sync occurs before the alpha
desynchronization. it was demonstrated that certain thalamic nuclei have a
strong influence in determining the alpha activity of the cortex. This
early work has led to three basic assumptions about alpha that are still
valid today: (i) alpha is not generated by a thalamic pacemaker. (ii)
Cortical alpha is modulated by a thalamo- cortico-thalamic reentrant
network. (iii) Alpha is not a unitary phenomenon, it comprises different
oscillations with different frequencies in a broad range. Besides these
rather basic aspects, however, almost nothing is known about the physiology
of alpha. Alpha desync is observed during the time in which conscious
task-related process  takes place, and alpha sync when top-down modulation
are needed for a task. Typically alpha would desync after the evoked
activity dissapears (around 200 or 300 ms poststimulus; which is similar to
what I see in the avshift data). We assume that upper alpha oscillations
are related to top-down processes in a complex sensory-seman- tic LTM
system that controls the access to and manipulation with stored
information. As an example, when a task requires that certain types of
processes must be performed with stored information (e.g., stored
information must be kept in mind, must not be retrieved or must be
manipulated by performing some transformation) alpha synchronizes over
respective brain areas. However, as soon as the memory trace actually is
retrieved (or a perceived stimulus is semantically categorized) which is a
process requiring a few 100 ms (depending on task difficulty and other
factors) alpha starts to desynchronize. We assume that during this early
period of stimulus encoding, phase-locked alpha reflects the top-down
influence of semantic categorization processes.

communicate if they are not matched in frequency, or their phases are not

the large amount of feedback connections from cortex to the thalamus.

stimuli, it is important to keep the representation of the attended stimuli
in mind. This is why attention and memory are related. Slow brain rhythms
are known to be related to memory. The interpreation of this result is that
when an internal representation of an expected stimulus meets a matching
sensory input, theta activity (reflecting top-down processes) and gamma
oscillations (representing bottom-up processes) become synchronized in
phase. Figure 3 contains the main result. It shows that when targets are
presented at the attended hemifield cross-frequency phase synchronization
(between post-stimulus 100 and 200 ms) increases at the contralateral brain
hemifield. Thus, their main result depends on attention. Other frequency
combinations (e.g. theta-beta) showed an increased coherence post-stimulus,
but none of them showed the attention effect. The authors rule out that
this effect was due to phase locking. The phase resetting figure 4 suggests
that the theta-gamma synchronization is established by a phase resetting in
the theta band.},

This is interpreted as memory matching between incoming visual information and

oscillatory brain activity in the integration of memory and attention

increased interregional phase-coupling. We conclude that memory information is

vs.\ non-attended. Preferred stimuli for V1 (A1)  are visual (auditory).
They show that attended and non-preferred stimuli reset the phase of
oscillations in V1 and A1, while non-attended stimuli do not. The authors
argue that prefer stimuli also triggers phase reset simultaneously with the
evoked response. This suggests
that phase reset could be an important neural mechanism for cross-modal
interactions. That phase locking is observed for non-preferred stimuli
suggests that attention could operate in a supramodal way. This supports
the hypothesis by the authors that at any given moment there is a single
perceptual modality that controls the whole brain oscillation dynamics and
therefore modulates the excitability temporal patterns of all brain
regions.

    Cortical excitability is the slave of ongoing neural oscillations. Buzsaki
and Chobak (1995) argued that neuronal oscillations constitute the
``context'' that affects processing of the ``content'' conveyed by specific
sensory inputs. There is a two way interaction between the
neurophysiological context and the sensory inputs that assures the most
effective sampling of our environment. The mechanism by which sensory
inputs can interact with context (neural oscillations) is phase reset.

Monkeys perform a two-stream auditory oddbal selection task in one of two
streams of auditory stimuli, where standards were presented at different rates.
These streams were presented simultaneously and monkeys were asked to detect
deviants in only one of them (selective attention condition), or in isolation
and masked were aske to detect deviants in the presented stream.

Figure~1 is a key figure. The middle pannel in the bottom row shows that
entrainment happens in neural ensembles tunned to the BFs matching and
non-matching the frequency of the inpunt stream, and it shows that for a given
input stream the CSD recorded at sites with BF matching the frequency of the
input stream is 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the CSD recorded at
sites with BF not matching the frequency of the input stream.

Figure~2 shows that the effects reported in Figure~1 are due to entrainment
(i.e., to the aligment of the phase of oscillatory activity). At sites with a
BF matching the frequency of the input stream phase is concentrated around
$\pi$
(maximal excitability) while at sites with BF not matching the frequency of the
input stream phse is concentrated around zero (minimum excitability).

Figure~3 provides evidence suggesting that the observed effect in Figure~1 is
not due to activity evoked by the presentation of stimuli, but due to the
reorganization of oscillatory activity. It shows that entrainment is visible
even after the presentation of the last stimulus.

Figure~4 shows that that the effect in Figure~1 can be seen for a broad range
of frequencies of the input stream (0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.2~Hz).

Figures~1-4 report the effect on a single (attended) input stream. Figure~5
investigates the effect when two input streams (with different frequencies of
presentation of standards) are simultaneously presented and attention is
directed to one of these streams. It shows that (1) no entrainment (significant
ITC) is observed for non-attended input streams (flat blue inset histograms),
(2) when the BF of the recording site matches the frequency of the input stream
(top-left and bottom-right panels in Figure~5a) the CSD before the presentation
of standards fluctuates in such a way that it is in a state of maximal
excitability before the presentation of standards (red trace is more negative
than blue trace immediately before zero in the CSD traces of the top-left and
bottom right panels), which leads to greater excitability (larger MUA in the
top-left and bottom right panels). The opossite effect happens at sites with BF
not matching the frequency of the input stream. Note that in the top row of
Figure~5 epochs are aligned to the presentation of standards in the 2~kHz
stream and in the bottom row ecpochs are aligned to the presentation of
standards in the 8~kHz stream. 

Figure~5b shows that no entrainment is observed for non-attended stimuli. 

Figure~5c shows the key finding of the paper that the phase of neuronal
ensembles whose BF does not match the frequency of stimulation is concentrated
around phases of minimal excitability while the phase of neuronal ensemblles
whose BF match the frequency of stimulation is concnetrated around phases of
maximal excitability.


Figure~6 presents evidence supporting the claim that changes in evoked
amplitude with attention are due to entrainment (phase alignment). Hypothesis 1
claims that attended stimuli should elicit less variation in amplitude, because
attended stimuli reset phases to a constant phase. Figures~6ab
show changes in evoked amplitude at BF and non-BF sites and, supporting
hypothesis 1, it reveals decrease in amplitude for attended stimuli.
Hypothesis 2 claims that the amplitude of ignored stimuli should depend on the
proximity of the ignored stimuli to attended non-BF stimuli (ignored stimuli
closer to the attended non-BF stimuli should elicit lower amplitude because the
attended non-BF stimuli takes the system to a less excitable state).
Figures~6cd suppor this hypothesis.

    ABSTRACT = {

Although we have convincing evidence that attention
to auditory stimuli modulates neuronal responses at
or before the level of primary auditory cortex (A1), the
underlying physiological mechanisms are unknown.
We found that attending to rhythmic auditory
streams resulted in the entrainment of ongoing 
oscillatory activity reflecting rhythmic excitability 
fluctuations in A1. Strikingly, although the rhythm of the
entrained oscillations in A1 neuronal ensembles 
reflected the temporal structure of the attended
stream, the phase depended on the attended frequency 
content. Counter-phase entrainment across
differently tuned A1 regions resulted in both the
amplification and sharpening of responses at
attended time points, in essence acting as a 
spectro-temporal filter mechanism. Our data suggest that
selective attention generates a dynamically evolving
model of attended auditory stimulus streams in the
form of modulatory subthreshold oscillations across
tonotopically organized neuronal ensembles in A1
that enhances the representation of attended stimuli.

Previous studies raise the hypothesis that attentional bias in the phase of
neocortical excitability fluctuations (oscillations) represents a fundamental
mechanism for tuning the brain to the temporal dynamics of task-relevant event
patterns. To evaluate this hypothesis, we recorded intracranial
electrocortical activity in human epilepsy patients while they performed an
audiovisual stream selection task. Consistent with our hypothesis, (1)
attentional modulation of oscillatory entrainment operates in a distinct
network of areas including auditory, visual, posterior parietal, inferior
motor, inferior frontal and superior midline frontal cortex, (2) the degree of
oscillatory entrainment depends on the predictability of the stimulus stream,
and (3) the attentional phase shift of entrained oscillation cooccurs with
classical attentional effects observed on phase-locked evoked activity in
sensory-specific areas but seems to operate on entrained low-frequency
oscillations that cannot be explained by sensory activity evoked at the rate
of stimulation. Thus, attentional entrainment appears to tune a network of
brain areas to the temporal dynamics of behaviorally relevant event streams,
contributing to its perceptual and behavioral selection.

Experiment identical at that in Lakatos et al. 2008 (audio-visual oddball
detection where stimuli was presented at 1.5~Hz in each modality. This
experiment is similar to our AVShift experiment). The authors find that the
phase of delta (1.5 Hz) oscillations before the presentation of standards align to opposite phases (180 degrees
apart) when attention is directed to the visual or auditory modality (Fig 2D).
This is a key finding. Very interestingly, the non-uniform distribution of
phases found in one third of the electrodes (Fig 1) could be due to (1) a
phase-locked evoked potentials or (2) to entrainment where a spontaneous
1.5~Hz oscillatory rhythm reorganizes its phase to follow the stimulation.
These two possibilitites can be distinguished electrophysiologically since in
(1) we should observe significant ITC values above the frequency of
stimulation, while in (2) we should mostly observe significant ITC at the
stimulation frequency. Beautifully, the two rightmost columns of Fig 3 shows
large values of ITC above the stim frequency in electrodes over A1 and V1, but
the three leftmost columns show significant ITC values only at the stimulation
frequency. This observation is quantified in Figure 4c that shows that the
amount of ITC is inversely proportional to the attentional delta phase shift.
Fig 4a shows that electrodes with large attentional delta phase shift are
localized in non-primary visual or auditory regions, but electrodes with large
phase-locking index are close to A1 and V1. Figure 5 is very good in
displaying the density of significant electrodes as a function of the density
of analyzed electrodes (it would not make sense to say that the density of
significant electrodes is 1.0 when the number of analyzed electordes is 1).
The proportion of analyzed electrodes showing entrainment
(entrainment/analyzed) was large over the superior temporal gyrus (extending
to the superior temporal sulcus), the angular gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus.
In contrast, the anterior frontal lobe and the anterior temporal lobe did not
show a significant entrainment to the stimulus stream, despite extensive
coverage (black areas). Among electrodes showing entrainment, the ventral
motor cortex, the top of the superior temporal cortex, the angular gyrus, and
the posterior fusiform gyrus showed a higher proportion of attentional phase
shifts, whereas the inferior somatosensory cortex and inferior and posterior
parts of the auditory cortex did not show any. In two subjects they repeated
the original experiment without any jitter and found that in the new
experiment the size of the shift if phase due to attention was larger than in
the original experiment (Fig 6).

    ABSTRACT = {

Neuroelectric oscillations reflect rhythmic shifting of neuronal ensembles
between high and low excitability states. In natural settings, important
stimuli often occur in rhythmic streams, and when oscillations entrain to an
input rhythm their high excitability phases coincide with events in the
stream, effectively amplifying neuronal input responses. When operating in a
'rhythmic mode', attention can use these differential excitability states as a
mechanism of selection by simply enforcing oscillatory entrainment to a
task-relevant input stream. When there is no low-frequency rhythm that
oscillations can entrain to, attention operates in a 'continuous mode',
characterized by extended increase in gamma synchrony. We review the evidence
for early sensory selection by oscillatory phase-amplitude modulations, its
mechanisms and its perceptual and behavioral consequences.

    },
    NOTE = {

This review presents evidence that attention can operate in two modes. It
operates in a rhythmic mode when stimuli is rhytmic and brain oscillations can
entrain, by phase reset, to the rhythm of the stimuli. In the rhythmic mode 
high excitability phases correspond to the time of presentation of relevant
stimuli. Low brain oscillations, e.g., delta, play a key role in this
entrainment. When the stimuli does not follow a rhythmic pattern it would be
disadvantegous to have low brain oscillations because relevant stimuli
could appear in phases of low excitability, and therefore be missed. Gamma
oscillations play a key role in this non-rhytmic, or continuous, mode of
attention.

Oscillations control neural excitability: the authors show that, as Bishop
has indicated, brain oscillations corresponds to states of low and high
neural excitability.

Oscillatory mechanisms of sensory enhancement: the authors distinguish
between driving inputs that generate action potentials and modulatory
inputs  that do not generate action potentials but that enhance sensory
processing for driving stimuli. They distinguish between stimulus-evoked
responses that require a pre- to post-stimuli increase in spectral power and
phase-resetting response that do not. Both type of responses involve phase
concentration.

Oscillations are used in attentional selection: for example gamma
oscillations are associated with attentive visual processing while delta
and theta oscillations have been related to active processing. Different
frequencies of oscillation seem to be coupled in a hierarchical way; that
is gamma amplitude can be coupled with theta phase, and theta amplitude
with delta phase.

Oscillatory mode of the system reflects task demands and predicts
behavioral performance: as outlined above, the authors believe the brain
has a rhythmic and a continuous mode of attention. They argue that the
rhythmic mode is the default, since requires less energy.

Subjects had to identify which of four possible letters were presented to
them for a very brief (57ms) period of time. 

The largest contribution of this article is the study of the relation
between inter-electrode phase coupling and perceptual performance.

Very nice description of their phase analysis (Fig. 2).

The authors found that the lower the alpha power the largest the detection
rate (Fig. 3b).

They classified the subjects as perceivers or non-perceivers and found that
perceivers had a lower resting alpha power (Fig. 3c).

They do an interesting analysis of phase coherence between electrodes. 

They mostly find significant coherence between frontal and parietal
electrodes. In the alpha range they found that the Phase Locking Value
(PLV), a measure based on averaging single trials, is lower for perceived
than for unperceived trials (Fig. 4a, 4c) and in the beta and gamma range
they found that the PLV is larger for perceived than for unperceived trails
(Fig. 4b, 4c).

They then use a single-trial measure (the deviation from the mean delta
phase) to compare single trials with identified and missed letters.
Consistently with the PLV finding they found that in trials with higher
larger deviations (more desynchronized) the detection rate was larger than
in trials with lower deviation (more syncrhonized, Fig 4d). Also, as in the
PLV analysis they found the opposite pattern for the beta and gamma ranges
(Figs. 4e and 4f). That is, the authors found that perception of stimuli is
related to low phase coupling in the alpha band and high phase coupling in
the beta and gamma bands.

oscillatory activity is causally linked with modulations of cortical
excitability and with visual perception. Transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) was applied over human visual cortex to induce illusory perceptions
(phosphenes) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded.
Subjects reported the presence or absence of an induced phosphene following a
single pulse of TMS at perceptual threshold. The phase of ongoing alpha (∼10
Hz) oscillations within 400 ms before the pulse significantly covaried with the
perceptual outcome. This effect was observed in occipital regions around the
site of TMS, as well as in a distant frontocentral region. In both regions, we
found a systematic relationship between prepulse EEG phase and perceptual
performance: phosphene probability changed by ∼15% between opposite phases. In
summary, we provide direct evidence for a chain of causal relations between the
phase of ongoing oscillations, neuronal excitability, and visual perception:
ongoing oscillations create periodic "windows of excitability," with sensory
perception being more likely to occur at specific phases.}

The authors use a psychophysical approach to study why when you present
simulaneously an auditory stimuli and visual stimuli (targets and
non-targets) the dectection of visual targets is enhanced. This could be a
bottom-up or a top-down effect. The authors present evidence supporting the
top-down explanation. In addition, they show that detection rates are
sinusoidally modulated after the presentation of the auditory stimuli. The
top-down effect appears to reset the phase of brain oscillations in such a
way that oscillations are on a phase of maximal excitability when visual
targets are more probable.

They present an auditory cue at time zero, and at each .5 sec from 0 to 6s
after the cue they present a visual target. The task of the subjects was to
detect the visual target. There were two conditions. In the equiprobable
condtion, the target could appear with equal probability at any time point.
In the AV-dominant condition the 0 (simultaneous) time point is four times
more probable than the rest of the time points (Figure 1). In Figure 2 they
replicate the known fact that (in the AV-dominant condition) detection
rates are higher when the visual target appears at the same time as the
cue. Probably the most interesting figures of the paper are Fig. 3a and
Fig. 4a where, using a model with a slow and a fast oscillation, the
authors show that target detection performance follow a sinusoidal
modulation. The detection sinusoidal modulation appears to occur at 1Hz
(Figure 5) and the phase of the oscillations appears to be reset so that
the sinusoids are at a point of maximal excitability when the target has the
largest probability of appearing (Figure 7).

Unlike the studies of Lakatos and Schroeder, where the stimuli was rhythmic,
the authors show that phase reset can appear in behavior when there is not
rhythm in the stimuli. In the work of Lakatos and Schroeder it is suggested
that attention is the only player that determine whether phase reset will
occur or not. This paper suggests that higher level expentancy (manipulated by
the probability of the stimuli; i.e., equiprobably and AV-condition)
determines if phase reset will occur or not.

An important effect of sustained attention is the facilitation of perception.
Although the term "sustained" suggests that this beneficial effect endures
continuously as long as something is attended, we present electrophysiological
evidence that perception at attended locations is actually modulated
periodically. Subjects detected brief light flashes that were presented
peripherally at locations that were either attended or unattended. We analyzed
the correlation between detection performance for attended and unattended
stimuli and the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations, which relate to subsecond
fluctuations of neuronal excitability. Although on average, detection
performance was improved by attention--indicated by reduced detection
thresholds at attended locations--we found that detection performance for
attended stimuli actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of
spontaneous oscillations in the (≈7 Hz) frequency band just before stimulus
onset. This fluctuation was absent for unattended stimuli. This pattern of
results suggests that "sustained" attention in fact exerts its facilitative
effect on perception in a periodic fashion.

Motor reaction times in humans are highly variable from one trial to the next,
even for simple and automatic tasks, such as shifting your gaze to a suddenly
appearing target. Although classic models of reaction time generation consider
this variability to reflect intrinsic noise, some portion of it could also be
attributed to ongoing neuronal processes. For example, variations of alpha
rhythm frequency (8 –12 Hz) across individuals, or alpha amplitude across
trials, have been related previously to manual reaction time variability. Here
we investigate the trial-by-trial influence of oscillatory phase, a dynamic
marker of ongoing activity, on saccadic reaction time in three paradigms of
increasing cognitive demand (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, and
visual discrimination tasks). The phase of ongoing pre-stimulus activity in the
high alpha/low beta range (11–17 Hz) at frontocentral locations was strongly
associated with saccadic response latencies. This relation, present in all
three paradigms, peaked for phases recorded ϳ50 ms before fixation point offset
and 250 ms before target onset. Reaction times in the most demanding
discrimination task fell into two distinct modes reflecting a fast but
inaccurate strategy or a slow and efficient one. The phase effect was markedly
stronger in the group of subjects using the faster strategy. We conclude that
periodic fluctuations of electrical activity attributable to neuronal
oscillations can modulate the efficiency of the oculomotor system on a rapid
timescale; however, this relation may be obscured when cognitive load also adds
a significant contribution to response time variability.

How does conscious perception evolve following stimulus presentation? The idea
that perception relies on discrete processing epochs has been often considered,
but never widely accepted. The alternative, a continuous translation of the
external world into explicit perception, although more intuitive and
subjectively appealing, cannot satisfactorily account for a large body of
psychophysical data. Cortical and thalamocortical oscillations in different
frequency bands could pro- vide a neuronal basis for such discrete processes,
but are rarely analyzed in this context. This article recon ciles the unduly
abandoned topic of discrete perception with current views and advances in

we investigated this possibility by examining whether attention-driven changes
in cortical activity are correlated with performance on a line-orientation
judgment task. We observed that, approximately 200 ms after a covert
attentional shift towards the impending visual stimulus, the level of
phase-resetting (transient neural coherence) within the calcarine significantly
increased for 2-10 Hz activity. This was followed by a suppression of alpha
activity (near 10 Hz) which persisted until the onset of the stimulus. The
levels of phase-resetting, alpha suppression and subsequent behavioral
performance varied between subjects in a systematic fashion. The magnitudes of
phase-resetting and alpha-band power were negatively correlated, with high
levels of coherence associated with high levels of performance. We propose that
top-down attentional control mechanisms exert their initial effects within the
calcarine through a phase-resetting within the 2-10 Hz band, which in turn
triggers a suppression of alpha activity, priming early visual areas for
incoming information and enhancing behavioral performance.}

C3. Nice way of only analizing EEG data (where the target appeared at the
third delay) uncontaminated with motor activity. Nice Figure 1 showing the
experimental design and the effect of temporal expectation on the CNV. Figure
2a shows an increased theta power at delay 1 for the u-shaped probability
distribution at electrode Cz(where a stimulus at delay 1 was more anticipated;
i.e., larger unticipated function in Figure 1b). Figure 2b shows larger ITC at
delay 1 for the u-shaped probability distribution at electrode Cz.
Importantly, the authors do not observe an effect of FP duration on the ITC,
as I seem to see in my avshift analysis. They do not observe a similar effect
on delta, alpha, or beta. They look for a relation between theta phase at Cz
and beta power at C3. Figure 3a shows (after averaging over subjects and time)
a large coupling between theta phase and beta power. Figure 3b shows that a
large phase amplitude coupling in a window after the presentation of the first
target for the u-shaped probability distribution only. Figure 4 shows that for
this distribution the beta power was larger for negative theta phase and
smaller for positive theta phase. To study if there was a relation between
phase-amplitude coupling and expectation, they used theta power as a measure
of expection (not sure how valid is this). They found that phase-amplitude
coupling was higher in trials with higher theta power around the first FP.
Give that the increase in phase-amplitude coupling ocurred at moments of high
temporal expectancy, the authors argue that phase-amplitude coupling may be
related to motor reprogramming.},

    abstract={Recent studies have associated increasing temporal expectations
with synchronization of higher frequency oscillations and suppression of lower
frequencies. In this experiment, we explore a proposal that low-frequency
oscillations provide a mechanism for regulating temporal expectations. We used
a speeded Go/No-go task and manipulated temporal expectations by changing the
probability of target presentation after certain intervals. Across two
conditions, the temporal conditional probability of target events differed
substantially at the first of three possible intervals. We found that reactions
times differed significantly at this first interval across conditions,
decreasing with higher temporal expectations. Interestingly, the power of theta
activity (4 – 8 Hz), distributed over central midline sites, also differed
significantly across conditions at this first interval. Furthermore, we found a
transient coupling between theta phase and beta power after the first interval
in the condition with high temporal expectation for targets at this time point.
Our results suggest that the adjustments in theta power and the phase-power
coupling between theta and beta contribute to a central mechanism for
controlling neural excitability according to temporal expectations.}

The effect of entrainment of brain oscillations by rhythmic stimulation has
been mostly demonstrated in reaction time measures.  The authors combine
phsychophysics with electrophysiology to show that rhythmic stimulation also
enhances performance in an orientation discriminability task.  The authors
show that 150~msec before the presentation time of a target stimulus, the
phase of EEG delta oscillations (1-4~Hz) cluster against the phase
corresponding to the largest gain in orientation discrimination.  Considering
the findings from Cravo et al. 2011 of effect of expectancy over central brain
regions in a Go/No-Go tasks, the authors argue (page 4009) that ``the sites
where temporal expectations modulate low-frequency oscillations, and
consequently the behavioral correspondece, are highly dependent on the task
demands.'' However, it may be possible that in Cravo et al. 2011 there were
modulations over occipital brain regions that were not tested by the authors.  

Figure 1b shows that subjects needed less contrast to perform at a given
accuracy level in the regular stream. There was also a significant increase in
mean reaction times for gratings presented in the regular stream.

Figure 2 shows a sustained increase of PLV (i.e., ITC) between -400~ms and the
presentation of the gratings. Surprisingly, the PLV also increaseses in the
100~ms before the presentation of the graiting.

For each time and each phase bin, the authors computed the proportion of
correct discrimination as a function of contrast, they fitted a signmoidal
function, and estimated the contrast corresponding to 75\% correct
discriminations. They call contrast grain to the negative of the logarithm of
this contrast. 

Figure 3a plots contrast grain as a function of time and phase.  Figure 3c
(V-Test) shows that for the regular condition the phase of oscillations was
concentrated around the phase of largest contrast grain between -150 and -50
msec before the presentation of the graiting.

Although it is increasingly accepted that temporal expectation can modulate
early perceptual processing, the underlying neural computations remain
unknown. In the present study, we combined a psychophysical paradigm with
electrophysiological recordings to investigate the putative contribution of
low-frequency oscillatory activity in mediating the modulation of visual
perception by temporal expectation. Human participants judged the orientation
of brief targets (visual Gabor patterns tilted clockwise or counterclockwise)
embedded within temporally regular or irregular streams of noise-patches used
as temporal cues. Psychophysical results indicated that temporal expectation
enhanced the contrast sensitivity of visual targets. A diffusion model
indicated that rhythmic temporal expectation modulated the signal-to-noise
gain of visual processing. The concurrent electrophysiological data revealed
that the phase of delta oscillations overlying human visual cortex (1-4 Hz)
was predictive of the quality of target processing only in regular streams of
events. Moreover, in the regular condition, the optimum phase of these
perception-predictive oscillations occurred in anticipation of the expected
events. Together, these results show a strong correspondence between
psychophysical and neurophysiological data, suggesting that the phase
entrainment of low-frequency oscillations to external sensory cues can serve
as an important and flexible mechanism for enhancing sensory processing.

both theta/alpha (around 7Hz) power (Figure 3a, right panel) and phase
(Figure 3b, right panel) predict subjects error rates. Phase and power seem
to be providing independent sources of information for predictions. The
most relevant power information occurs 0.492 seconds before (target) stimulus
presentation at
8.2Hz, while the most relevant phase information occurs 0.120 seconds
before stimulus presentation at 7.1Hz. To predict from phase they use the ``phase
bifurcation index.'' It is interesting the suggestion that the brain could

Oscillations are ubiquitous in electrical recordings of brain activity. While
the amplitude of ongoing oscillatory activity is known to correlate with
various aspects of perception, the influence of oscillatory phase on
perception remains unknown. In particular, since phase varies on a much faster
timescale than the more sluggish amplitude fluctuations, phase effects could
reveal the fine-grained neural mechanisms underlying perception. We presented
brief flashes of light at the individual luminance threshold while EEG was
recorded. Although the stimulus on each trial was identical, subjects detected
approximately half of the flashes (hits) and entirely missed the other half
(misses). Phase distributions across trials were compared between hits and
misses. We found that shortly before stimulus onset, each of the two
distributions exhibited significant phase concentration, but at different
phase angles. This effect was strongest in the theta and alpha frequency
bands. In this time-frequency range, oscillatory phase accounted for at least
16\% of variability in detection performance and allowed the prediction of
performance on the single-trial level. This finding indicates that the visual
detection threshold fluctuates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG
activity. The results support the notion that ongoing oscillations shape our
perception, possibly by providing a temporal reference frame for neural codes
that rely on precise spike timing.

An event in one sensory modality can phase reset brain oscillations concerning
another modality. In principle, this may result in stimulus-locked periodicity
in behavioral performance. Here we considered this possible cross-modal impact
of a sound for one of the best-characterized rhythms arising from the visual
system, namely occipital alpha-oscillations (8-14 Hz). We presented brief
sounds and concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and/or probed
visual cortex excitability (phosphene perception) through occipital
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In a first, TMS-only experiment,
phosphene perception rate against time postsound showed a periodic pattern
cycling at ~10 Hz phase-aligned to the sound. In a second, combined TMS-EEG
experiment, TMS-trials reproduced the cyclical phosphene pattern and revealed
a ~10 Hz pattern also for EEG-derived measures of occipital cortex reactivity
to the TMS pulses. Crucially, EEG-data from intermingled trials without TMS
established cross-modal phase-locking of occipitoparietal alpha oscillations.
These independently recorded variables, i.e., occipital cortex excitability
and reactivity and EEG phase dynamics, were significantly correlated. This
shows that cross-modal phase locking of oscillatory visual cortex activity can
arise in the human brain to affect perceptual and EEG measures of visual
processing in a cyclical manner, consistent with occipital alpha oscillations
underlying a rapid cycling of neural excitability in visual areas.},
    NOTE = {

The authors show evidence supporting that a sound may phase align alpha in
occipital brain regions. They present a sound at time zero and probe neural
excitability in parieto-occipital cortex with TMS. They demonstrate a
correlation between phosphene preception (visual cortex excitability) and
phase and amplitude of EEG oscillations. In Fig. 1 they show a 10 Hz
pattern of parieto-occital excitability (as demonstrated by TMS). In Fig. 2
they show, in non-TMS trials, that phase reset in parieto-occipital cortex
also follows an 10 Hz pattern of phase reset and that the larger the phase
reset the larger the larger the parieto-occipital excitability. In Fig. 3
they show, in TMS trials, that the proportion of phosphene perception is
related to alpha desynchronization in the parieto-occipital brain region.
In Fig. S2 they show a correlation between the frequency of phosphene
perception and IAF (participants with slower IAF showed slower frequency of
phase perception).

The authors presented a visual cue (S1) instructing subjects to attend to
the visual (Flash) or auditory (Beep) modality. Following the cue an
audio-visual stimuli (S2) was presented and subjects had to detect visual
or auditory targets, as indicated by the cue stimuli. They find evidence of
anticipatory attention before the target presentation and argue that alpha
synchronization does not reflect an iddling brain but active suppresion of
non-relevant stimuli. When the cue
indicates to attend to the auditory modality they observe alpha
synchronization in occipital brain regions in the 300 ms before the target
presentation (Fig. 2c). This synchronization suggests that the brain is
disengaging from the visual modality when the visual component of the
stimuli serves as a distracter. The authors see larger Scalp
Current Density (SCD) after the auditory cue than after the visual one
(Figure 3a). The only region (out of the five tested) displaying in 11 of
12 subjects larger differences between the Flash and the Beep cues was the
parieto-occipital region (Figure 3B). They show that the root-mean-square
amplitude of the 10 Hz filtered EEG activity was larger after the Beep than
after the Flash cue (Figure 3C).

Now I understand the meaning of attention bias:
``The result of focusing attention to one sensory
modality in the presence of others is to single out
incoming stimuli of that modality for preferential
processing. In order to achieve this, there needs to
be a biased attentional state set in place before the
occurrence of these stimuli that impacts their subse-
quent stimulus-driven processing.''

Previous investigation have related the anticipatory alpha rhythm with
perception. However, it is still unknown whether the alpha rhythm is a
consequence of perceptual processes or if it causes perception. Here, the
authors perform a TMS + visual target detection task and provide evidence
suggesting that alpha rhythms cause perception. Subjects had to detect a
small dot presented for a brief time (23.5 ms) and in some trials a 5 pulse
TMS stimulation was applied in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands
over occipital and parietal brain regions. Figure 2a is the central figure
of the paper. It shows that the improvement in hit rates (hit rate in TMS
trials - hit rate in sham trials) was significantly larger at 10 Hz than at
5 Hz or 20 Hz for targets presented ipsilaterally as the hemisfphere of TMS
application, but that it is significantly lower at 10 Hz than at 5 Hz or 20
Hz for targets presented contralaterally. There were not significant
differences between parietal and occipital or left and right brain regions.
Moreover, only at 10 Hz the difference between ipsilateral and
contralateral TMS stimulation is significant. They tested target visibility
at seven time points after the TMS stimulation (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18
seconds) and in Figure 3 they showed that the differences reported in Fig.
2a occurred were shoft lived (only evident for targets presented at 0
seconds). They conclude that alpha regulates the flow of incoming
information by anticipatorily tunning retinotopically organized areas.

The authors perform two EEG experiments. In experiment one four tones of
different frequency predicted, with probability proportional to the tone
frequency, the ocurrence of a forthcoming target. In experiment two cue one
predicted the early onset of a target with 20\% probability and the late onset
with 80\% probability, and cue two predicted the early onset of a target with
80\% probability and the late onset with 20\% probability. 

Figure 1 shows the experiments and that in both experiments the target
probability modulated reaction times.

The more expected a stimulus is the larger the phase reset (or phase
entrainment, as the authors like to call), in the delta band (0.5-3 Hz), the
warning signal (or cue) generates at the target onset time (Figure 2 A-H for
experiment 1, and Figure 2 I-L for experiment 2). 

Interestingly, the phase of single trials significantly correlated with
subjects reaction times, as well as with the amplitude and peak latency of the
delta component of the P300, and the strength and significance of these
correlations increase with the degree expectancy of a target (Figure 4). 

I like the idea of predicting, or correlating, the P300.

modality are rarely independent. Sounds often follow a visible action or event.
Here we present behaviorally relevant evidence from the human EEG that visual
input prepares the auditory system for subsequent auditory processing by
resetting the phase of neuronal oscillatory activity in auditory cortex.
Subjects performed a simple auditory frequency discrimination task using paired
but asynchronous auditory and visual stimuli. Auditory cortex activity was
modeled from the scalp-recorded EEG using spatiotemporal dipole source
analysis. Phase resetting activity was assessed using time–frequency analysis
of the source waveforms. Significant cross-modal phase resetting was observed
in auditory cortex at low alpha frequencies (8 –10 Hz) peaking 80 ms after
auditory onset, at high alpha frequencies (10 –12 Hz) peaking at 88 ms, and at
high theta frequencies (ϳ7 Hz) peaking at 156 ms. Importantly, significant
effects were only evident when visual input preceded auditory by between 30 and
75 ms. Behaviorally, cross-modal phase resetting accounted for 18\% of the
variability in response speed in the auditory task, with stronger resetting
overall leading to significantly faster responses. A direct link was thus shown
between visual-induced modulations of auditory cortex activity and performance
in an auditory task. The results are consistent with a model in which the
efficiency of auditory processing is improved when natural associations between
visual and auditory inputs allow one input to reliably predict the next.},
    NOTE = {This paper argues that visual stimuli resets the phase of auditory
cortex in an auditory discrimination task with audio-visual stimulation (Figure
1). Figure 2 shows that the addition of visual stimulation leads to
improvements in reaction times to auditory stimuli. Figure 3 shows grand average ERPs in sensor and
source space. Figure 4 shows ITC and ERPs for unisensori responses. Figure 5
shows averaged ITCs and ERSPs across subjects and sources in auditory cortex.
It is so brutal that the authors are averaging across subjects, but hopefully
this is only for display purposes. Figure 6 is probably the main figure of the
manuscript; Fig. 6a shows the loading of the PCs with peak ITC values differing
across AV condition. It is good that the authors are careful to claim that
phase reset is related to increase in ITC without an increease in ERSP. Figure
7 shows peak back-projected ITC values (a), and mean power (b). For Fig 7c they
predict mean RTs using all extracted PCs as independent variables in a stepwise
linear regression procedure. The authors do not comment on the use of
cross-validations, so probably these fits are overfitted.}

The ability to focus on and understand one talker in a noisy social

brain's representation of speech using a "Cocktail Party" paradigm, coupled
with direct recordings from the cortical surface in surgical epilepsy
patients. We find that brain activity dynamically tracks speech streams using
both low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude fluctuations and that
optimal encoding likely combines the two. In and near low-level auditory
cortices, attention "modulates" the representation by enhancing cortical
tracking of attended speech streams, but ignored speech remains represented.
In higher-order regions, the representation appears to become more
"selective," in that there is no detectable tracking of ignored speech. This
selectivity itself seems to sharpen as a sentence unfolds.

Spontaneous brain oscillations are assumed to be the underlying mechanism of

identical stimulus results in different perceptual outcomes. Past results,
however, can only account for a correlation of perception with the phase of the
ongoing brain oscillations. Therefore, it is desirable to demonstrate a causal
relation between phase and perception. One way to address this question is to
entrain spontaneous brain oscillations by applying an external oscillation and
then demonstrate behavioral consequences of this oscillation. We conducted an
auditory detection experiment with humans, recorded the electroencephalogram
(EEG) concurrently and simultaneously applied oscillating transcranial direct
current stimulation at 10Hz ($\alpha$-tDCS). Our approach revealed that detection
thresholds were dependent on the phase of the oscillation that was entrained by
$\alpha$-tDCS. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an electrophysiological
effect: α-power was enhanced after $\alpha$-tDCS as compared to a pre-stimulation
period. By showing a causal relation between phase and perception, our results
extend findings of previous studies that were only able to demonstrate a
correlation. We found that manipulation of the phase resulted in different
detection thresholds, which supports the notion that perception can be
periodically modulated by oscillatory processes. This demonstrates that tDCS
can serve as a tool in neuroscience to extend the knowledge of the functional

    ABSTRACT = {
Rhythmic synchronization of neurons in the beta or gamma band occurs almost
ubiquitously, and this synchronization has been linked to numerous nervous
system functions. Many respective studies make the implicit assumption that
neuronal synchronization affects neuronal interactions. Indeed, when neurons
synchronize, their output spikes reach postsynaptic neurons together, trigger
coincidence detection mechanisms, and therefore have an enhanced impact. There
is ample experimental evidence demonstrating this consequence of neuronal
synchronization, but beyond this, beta/gamma-band synchronization within a
group of neurons might also modulate the impact of synaptic input to that
synchronized group. This would constitute a separate mechanism through which
synchronization affects neuronal interactions, but direct in vivo evidence for
this putative mechanism is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that synchronized
beta-band activity of a neuronal group modulates the efficacy of synaptic input
to that group in-phase with the beta rhythm. This response modulation was not
an addition of rhythmic activity onto the average response but a rhythmic
modulation of multiplicative input gain. Our results demonstrate that
beta-rhythmic activity of a neuronal target group multiplexes input gain along
the rhythm cycle. The actual gain of an input then depends on the precision and
the phase of its rhythmic synchronization to this target, providing one
mechanistic explanation for why synchronization modulates interactions.

endogenous alpha power in parieto-central electrodes of the
electroencephalogram. Additionally, in a network of spiking neurons, we
simulated how tACS can be affected even after the end of stimulation. The
results show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) selectively
modulates synapses depending on the resonance frequencies of the neural
circuits that they belong to. Thus, tACS influences STDP which in turn results
in aftereffects upon neural activity.The present findings are the first direct
electrophysiological evidence of an interaction of tACS and ongoing oscillatory
activity in the human cortex. The data demonstrate the ability of tACS to
specifically modulate oscillatory brain activity and show its potential both at

Prestimulus oscillatory neural activity in the visual cortex has large
consequences for perception and can be influenced by top-down control from
higher-order brain regions. Making a causal claim about the mechanistic role
of oscillatory activity requires that oscillations be directly manipulated
independently of cognitive instructions. There are indications that a direct
manipulation, or entrainment, of visual alpha activity is possible through
visual stimulation. However, three important questions remain: (1) Can the
entrained alpha activity be endogenously maintained in the absence of
continuous stimulation?; (2) Does entrainment of alpha activity reflect a
global or a local process?; and (3) Does the entrained alpha activity
influence perception? To address these questions, we presented human subjects
with rhythmic stimuli in one visual hemifield, and arhythmic stimuli in the
other. After rhythmic entrainment, we found a periodic pattern in detection
performance of near-threshold targets specific to the entrained hemifield.
Using magnetoencephalograhy to measure ongoing brain activity, we observed
strong alpha activity contralateral to the rhythmic stimulation outlasting the
stimulation by several cycles. This entrained alpha activity was produced
locally in early visual cortex, as revealed by source analysis. Importantly,
stronger alpha entrainment predicted a stronger phasic modulation of detection
performance in the entrained hemifield. These findings argue for a cortically
focal entrainment of ongoing alpha oscillations by visual stimulation, with
concomitant consequences for perception. Our results support the notion that
oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band provides a causal mechanism for
the temporal organization of visual perception.

Selective attention uses temporal regularity of relevant inputs to bias the
phase of ongoing population-level neuronal oscillations. This phase
entrainment streamlines processing, allowing attended information to arrive at
moments of high neural excitability. How entrainment resolves competition
between spatially segregated inputs during visuospatial tasks is not yet
established. Using high-density electroencephalography in humans, a bilateral
entrainment response to the rhythm (1.3 or 1.5 Hz) of an attended stimulation
stream was observed, concurrent with a considerably weaker contralateral
entrainment to a competing rhythm. That ipsilateral visual areas strongly
entrained to the attended stimulus is notable because competitive inputs to
these regions were being driven at an entirely different rhythm. Strong
modulations of phase locking and weak modulations of single-trial power
suggest that entrainment was primarily driven by phase-alignment of ongoing
oscillatory activity. In addition, interhemispheric differences in entrained
phase were found to be modulated by attended hemifield, implying that the
bilateral nature of the response reflected a functional flow of information
between hemispheres. This modulation was strongest at the third of at least
four harmonics that were strongly entrained. Ipsilateral increases in
alpha-band (8-12 Hz) power were also observed during bilateral entrainment,
reflecting suppression of the ignored stimulation stream. Furthermore, both
entrainment and alpha lateralization significantly affected task performance.
We conclude that oscillatory entrainment is a functionally relevant mechanism
that synchronizes endogenous activity across the cortical hierarchy to resolve
spatial competition. We further speculate that concurrent suppression of
ignored input might facilitate the widespread propagation of attended
information during spatial attention.

frequency. Theoretically, brain oscillations could underlie the rhythmic nature
of perception by providing transient time windows for information exchange, but
this question has not yet been systematically addressed. We recorded
simultaneous EEG-fMRI while human participants performed a contour integration
task and show that ongoing brain oscillations prior to stimulus onset predict
functional connectivity between higher and lower level visual processing
regions. Specifically, our results demonstrate that the phase of a 7 Hz
oscillation prior to stimulus onset predicts perceptual performance and the
bidirectional information flow between the left lateral occipital cortex and
right intraparietal sulcus, as indicated by psychophysiological interaction and
dynamic causal modeling. These findings suggest that human brain oscillations
periodically gate visual perception at around 7 Hz by providing transient time
windows for long-distance cortical information transfer. Such gating might be a
general mechanism underlying the rhythmic nature of human perception.}

might be due to perception relying on discrete processing. According to this
view, two events may be judged as sequential or simultaneous, depending on
their temporal relationship within a discrete neuronal process. To assess if
alpha oscillations underlie this discrete neuronal process, we investigated how
these oscillations modulate the judgment of causality. We used the classic
launching effect with concurrent recording of EEG signal. In each trial, a disk
moved horizontally toward a second disk at the center of the screen and stopped
when they touched each other. After a delay that varied between 0 and 400 msec
after contact, the right disk began to move. Participants were instructed to
judge whether or not they had a feeling that the first disk caused the movement

biased causality estimates. Moreover, we found that alpha phase was
concentrated around different angles for trials in which participants judged
events as causally related versus not causally related. We conclude that alpha

resulting in improved processing. The current experiment goes beyond previous
work in this domain by addressing two thus far unanswered questions. First, how
general is neural entrainment to environmental rhythms: Can neural oscillations
be entrained by temporal dynamics of ongoing rhythmic stimuli without abrupt
onsets? Second, does neural entrainment optimize performance of the perceptual
system: Does human auditory perception benefit from neural phase
reorganization? In a human electroencephalography study, listeners detected
short gaps distributed uniformly with respect to the phase angle of a 3-Hz
frequency-modulated stimulus. Listeners’ ability to detect gaps in the
frequency-modulated sound was not uniformly distributed in time, but clustered
in certain preferred phases of the modulation. Moreover, the optimal stimulus
phase was individually determined by the neural delta oscillation entrained by
the stimulus. Finally, delta phase predicted behavior better than stimulus
phase or the event-related potential after the gap. This study demonstrates
behavioral benefits of phase realignment in response to frequency-modulated
auditory stimuli, overall suggesting that frequency fluctuations in natural
environmental input provide a pacing signal for endogenous neural oscillations,
thereby influencing perceptual processing.}

stream. Here, we explored the effects of a rhythmic stimulus on subsequent
auditory perception. We found that a low-frequency (3 Hz), amplitude-modulated
signal induces a subsequent oscillation of the perceptual detectability of a
brief nonperiodic acoustic stimulus (1-kHz tone); the frequency but not the
phase of the perceptual oscillation matches the entrained stimulus-driven
rhythmic oscillation. This provides evidence that rhythmic contexts have a
direct influence on subsequent auditory perception of discrete acoustic events.

Although waveforms vary greatly from trial to trial due to activity unrelated to the stimulus, it has been demonstrated that spoken sentences can be discriminated based on theta-band (3–7 Hz) phase patterns in single-trial response waveforms. Furthermore, manipulations of the speech signal envelope and fine structure that reduced intelligibility were found to produce correlated reductions in discrimination performance, suggesting a relationship between theta-band phase patterns and speech comprehension. This study investigates the nature of this relationship, hypothesizing that theta-band phase patterns primarily reflect cortical processing of low-frequency (<40 Hz) modulations present in the acoustic signal and required for intelligibility, rather than processing exclusively related to comprehension (e.g., lexical, syntactic, semantic). Using stimuli that are quite similar to normal spoken sentences in terms of low-frequency modulation characteristics but are unintelligible (i.e., their time-inverted counterparts), we find that discrimination performance based on theta-band phase patterns is equal for both types of stimuli. Consistent with earlier findings, we also observe that whereas theta-band phase patterns differ across stimuli, power patterns do not. We use a simulation model of the single-trial response to spoken sentence stimuli to demonstrate that phase-locked responses to low-frequency modulations of the acoustic signal can account not only for the phase but also for the power results. The simulation offers insight into the interpretation of the empirical results with respect to phase-resetting and power-enhancement models of the evoked response.}

is dominated by theta (3-7 Hz) frequencies when observed via

The conventional method used to distinguish between the two hypotheses is the
comparison of post- to prestimulus amplitude for the phase-locked frequency
across a set of trials. In theory, increased amplitude indicates the presence
of additive activity, while unchanged amplitude points to phase-resetting.
However, this interpretation may not be valid if the amplitude of ongoing
background activity also changes following the stimulus. In this study, we
employ a new approach that circumvents this problem. Specifically, we utilize a
fine-grained time-frequency analysis of MEG channel data to examine the
co-modulation of amplitude change and phase coherence in the post-stimulus
theta-band response. If the phase-locked response is attributable solely to
phase-resetting of the ongoing theta oscillation, then amplitude and phase
coherence should be uncorrelated. In contrast, additive activity should produce
a positive correlation. We find significant positive correlation not only
during the onset response but also throughout the response period. In fact,
transient increases in phase coherence are accompanied by transient increases
in amplitude in accordance with a "signal plus background" model of the evoked

spontaneous state of alpha band activity would correlate with trial-by-trial
fluctuations in visual WM. Electroencephalography recorded from human observers
during a visual WM task revealed that the prestimulus desynchronization of
alpha oscillations predicts the accuracy of memory recall on a trial-by-trial
basis. A model-based analysis indicated that this effect arises from a
modulation in the precision of memorized items, but not the likelihood of
remembering them (the recall rate). The phase of posterior alpha oscillations
preceding the memorized item also predicted memory accuracy. Based on
correlations between prestimulus alpha levels and stimulus-related visual
evoked responses, we speculate that the prestimulus state of the visual system
prefigures a cascade of state-dependent processes, ultimately affecting
WM-guided behavior. Overall, our results indicate that spontaneous changes in
cortical excitability can have profound consequences for higher visual
cognition.}

rhythms abound at frequencies at or below 10 Hz. Neuronal rhythms cover a very
wide frequency range, and the phase of neuronal low-frequency rhythms often
rhythmically modulates the strength of higher-frequency rhythms, particularly
of gamma-band synchronization (GBS). Here, we study stimulus-induced GBS in
awake monkey areas V1 and V4 in relation to a specific form of spontaneous
behavior, namely microsaccades (MSs), small fixational eye movements. We found
that MSs occur rhythmically at a frequency of approximately 3.3 Hz. The
rhythmic MSs were predicted by the phase of the 3.3 Hz rhythm in V1 and V4
local field potentials. In turn, the MSs modulated both visually induced GBS
and the speed of visually triggered behavioral responses. Fast/slow responses
were preceded by a specific temporal pattern of MSs. These MS patterns induced
perturbations in GBS that in turn explained variability in behavioral response
speed. We hypothesize that the 3.3 Hz rhythm structures the sampling and
exploration of the environment through building and breaking neuronal ensembles
synchronized in the gamma-frequency band to process sensory stimuli.}

researched. While most research focuses on event-related changes of brain

internal brain states influencing information processing. Several studies
suggest amplitude changes of EEG oscillatory activity selectively influencing
cortical excitability, and more recently it was shown that phase of EEG
activity (instantaneous phase) conveys additional meaning. Here we review this
field with many conflicting findings and further investigate whether
corticospinal excitability in the resting brain is dependent on a specific
spontaneously occurring brain state reflected by amplitude and instantaneous
phase of EEG oscillations. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) over the left sensorimotor cortex, while simultaneously
recording ongoing oscillatory activity with EEG. Results indicate that brain
oscillations reflect rapid, spontaneous fluctuations of cortical excitability.
Instantaneous phase but not amplitude of oscillations at various frequency
bands at stimulation site at the time of TMS-pulse is indicative for brain
states associated with different levels of excitability (defined by size of the
elicited motor evoked potential). These results are further evidence that
ongoing brain oscillations directly influence neural excitability which puts
further emphasis on their role in orchestrating neuronal firing in the brain.}

Current theories of visual search postulate an early stage of feature
extraction interacting with an attentional process that selects candidate
targets for further analysis; in difficult search situations, this selection is
iterated until the target is found. Although such theories predict an intrinsic
periodicity in the neuronal substrates of attentional search, this prediction
has not been extensively tested in human electrophysiology. Here, using EEG and
TMS, we study attentional periodicities in visual search. EEG measurements
indicated that successful and unsuccessful search trials were associated with
different amounts of poststimulus oscillatory amplitude and phase-locking at ∼6
Hz and opposite prestimulus oscillatory phase at ∼6 Hz. A trial-by-trial
comparison of pre- and poststimulus ∼6 Hz EEG phases revealed that the
functional interplay between prestimulus brain states, poststimulus
oscillations, and successful search performance was mediated by a partial phase
reset of ongoing oscillations. Independently, TMS applied over occipital cortex
at various intervals after search onset demonstrated a periodic pattern of
interference at ∼6 Hz. The converging evidence from independent TMS and EEG
measurements demonstrates that attentional search is modulated periodically by
brain oscillations. This periodicity is naturally compatible with a sequential
exploration by attention, although a parallel but rhythmically modulated
attention spotlight cannot be entirely ruled out.}

even under adverse listening conditions. This ability critically relies on
dynamically updated predictions of incoming sensory information, but exactly
how top-down predictions improve speech processing is still unclear. Brain
oscillations are a likely mechanism for these top-down predictions [1, 2].
Quasi-rhythmic components in speech are known to entrain low-frequency
oscillations in auditory areas [3, 4], and this entrainment increases with
intelligibility [5]. We hypothesize that top-down signals from frontal brain
areas causally modulate the phase of brain oscillations in auditory cortex. We
use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to monitor brain oscillations in 22
participants during continuous speech perception. We characterize prominent
spectral components of speech-brain coupling in auditory cortex and use causal
connectivity analysis (transfer entropy) to identify the top-down signals
driving this coupling more strongly during intelligible speech than during
unintelligible speech. We report three main findings. First, frontal and motor
cortices significantly modulate the phase of speech-coupled low-frequency
oscillations in auditory cortex, and this effect depends on intelligibility of
speech. Second, top-down signals are significantly stronger for left auditory
cortex than for right auditory cortex. Third, speech-auditory cortex coupling
is enhanced as a function of stronger top-down signals. Together, our results
suggest that low-frequency brain oscillations play a role in implementing
predictive top-down control during continuous speech perception and that
top-down control is largely directed at left auditory cortex. This suggests a
close relationship between (left-lateralized) speech production areas and the
implementation of top-down control in continuous speech perception.}

However, how this alignment between speech acoustics and neural oscillations
might underpin intelligibility is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that the
'sharpness' of temporal fluctuations in the critical band envelope acts as a
temporal cue to speech syllabic rate, driving delta-theta rhythms to track the
stimulus and facilitate intelligibility. We interpret our findings as evidence
that sharp events in the stimulus cause cortical rhythms to re-align and parse
the stimulus into syllable-sized chunks for further decoding. Using
magnetoencephalographic recordings, we show that by removing temporal
fluctuations that occur at the syllabic rate, envelope-tracking activity is
reduced. By artificially reinstating these temporal fluctuations,
envelope-tracking activity is regained. These changes in tracking correlate
with intelligibility of the stimulus. Together, the results suggest that the
sharpness of fluctuations in the stimulus, as reflected in the cochlear output,
drive oscillatory activity to track and entrain to the stimulus, at its
syllabic rate. This process likely facilitates parsing of the stimulus into
meaningful chunks appropriate for subsequent decoding, enhancing perception and
intelligibility.}

combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with psychophysics to address the issue.
We demonstrate that the establishment of a reliable neuronal phase pattern in

patterns are memorized, as reflected in behavior, and gradually produce robust
phase responses in auditory cortex. Moreover, different memorized noises elicit
distinguishable phase responses, suggesting their specificity to noise

We analyzed cortical responses from an epileptic patient with a rare bilateral
electrode implantation (stereotactic EEG) in primary (A1/BA41 and A2/BA42) and
association auditory cortices (BA22). Using time-frequency analyses, we
confirmed the dominance of a 5-6 Hz theta activity in right and of a low-gamma

resting state and syllable processing. We further detected high-theta (7-8 Hz)
resting activity in left primary, but also associative auditory regions. In
left BA22, its phase correlated with high-gamma induced power. Such a
hierarchical relationship across theta and gamma frequency bands (theta/gamma
phase-amplitude coupling) could index the process by which the neural code
shifts from stimulus feature- to phonological-encoding, and is associated with
the transition from evoked to induced power responses. These data suggest that
theta and gamma activity in right and left auditory cortices bear different
functions. They support a scheme where slow parsing of the acoustic information
dominates in right hemisphere at a syllabic (5-6 Hz) rate, and left auditory
cortex exhibits a more complex cascade of oscillations, reflecting the possible
extraction of transient acoustic cues at a fast (~25-45 Hz) rate, subsequently
integrated at a slower, e.g., syllabic one. Slow oscillations could
functionally participate to speech processing by structuring gamma activity in

roughly match spontaneous and evoked modulation rates of primary auditory
cortex neurons. To test the importance of cortical modulation rates for speech
processing, we manipulated the frequency of the temporal envelope of speech
sentences and tested the effect on both speech comprehension and cortical
activity. Magnetoencephalographic signals from the auditory cortices of human
subjects were recorded while they were performing a speech comprehension task.
The test sentences used in this task were compressed in time. Speech
comprehension was degraded when sentence stimuli were presented in more rapid
(more compressed) forms. We found that the average comprehension level, at each
compression, correlated with (i) the similarity between the frequencies of the
temporal envelopes of the stimulus and the subject's cortical activity
("stimulus-cortex frequency-matching") and (ii) the phase-locking (PL) between
the two temporal envelopes ("stimulus-cortex PL"). Of these two correlates, PL
was significantly more indicative for single-trial success. Our results suggest
that the match between the speech rate and the a priori modulation capacities
of the auditory cortex is a prerequisite for comprehension. However, this is

timescales that correspond to lower frequencies [delta (1-3 Hz)] also reflect
important linguistic features-prosodic/suprasegmental-but it is unknown whether
the patterns of activity in this range are similar to theta. We investigate
low-frequency activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and mutual information

frequency subband examined [delta (1-3 Hz), theta(low) (3-5 Hz), theta(high)
(5-7 Hz)] processes independent information from the speech stream. This
contrasts with hypotheses that either delta and theta reflect their
corresponding linguistic levels of analysis or each band is part of a single
holistic onset response that tracks global acoustic transitions in the speech
stream. Single-trial template-based classifier results further validate this
finding: information from each subband can be used to classify individual
sentences, and classifier results that utilize the combination of frequency
bands provide better results than single bands alone. Our results suggest that
during speech perception low-frequency phase of the MEG signal corresponds to
neither abstract linguistic units nor holistic evoked potentials but rather
tracks different aspects of the input signal. This study also validates a new

of sound stimulation in auditory cortices and motor-related areas including the
sensorimotor cortex, inferior-frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and the

consistent regardless of the rate or regularity of the stimulus, but the time
course of the following beta rebound depended on the stimulus rate only in the
regular stimulus conditions such that the beta amplitude reached its maximum

were more frequently reported as consciously seen, relative to unpredictive

alpha-band oscillations, before target onset, toward each participant's optimal
phase for stimulus discrimination. These findings provide direct evidence that
forming predictions about when a stimulus will appear can bias the phase of
ongoing alpha-band oscillations toward an optimal phase for visual processing,

δ-oscillations to the periodic occurrence of sounds has been suggested to
function as a mechanism of attentional selection. Here, we examine in humans
whether the detection of brief near-threshold sounds in quiet depends on the
phase of EEG oscillations. When stimuli were presented at irregular intervals,
we did not find a systematic relationship between detection probability and
phase. When stimuli were presented at regular intervals (2-s), reaction times
were significantly shorter and we observed phase entrainment of EEG
oscillations corresponding to the frequency of stimulus presentation (0.5 Hz),
revealing an adjustment of the system to the regular stimulation. The amplitude
of the entrained oscillation was higher for hits than for misses, suggesting a
link between entrainment and stimulus detection. However, detection was
independent of phase at frequencies ≥1 Hz. Furthermore, we show that when the
data are analyzed using acausal, though common, algorithms, an apparent
"entrainment" of the δ-phase to presented stimuli emerges and detection
probability appears to depend on δ-phase, similar to reports in the literature.
We show that these effects are artifacts from phase distortion at stimulus
onset by contamination with the event-related potential, which differs markedly
for hits and misses. This highlights the need to carefully deal with this
common problem, since otherwise it might bias and mislead this exciting field

  abstract={Given the limited processing capabilities of the sensory system, it
is essential that attended information is gated to downstream areas, whereas
unattended information is blocked. While it has been proposed that alpha band
(8-13 Hz) activity serves to route information to downstream regions by
inhibiting neuronal processing in task-irrelevant regions, this hypothesis
remains untested. Here we investigate how neuronal oscillations detected by
electroencephalography in visual areas during working memory encoding serve to
gate information reflected in the simultaneously recorded
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals recorded by functional
magnetic resonance imaging in downstream ventral regions. We used a paradigm in
which 16 participants were presented with faces and landscapes in the right and
left hemifields; one hemifield was attended and the other unattended. We
observed that decreased alpha power contralateral to the attended object
predicted the BOLD signal representing the attended object in ventral
object-selective regions. Furthermore, increased alpha power ipsilateral to the
attended object predicted a decrease in the BOLD signal representing the
unattended object. We also found that the BOLD signal in the dorsal attention
network inversely correlated with visual alpha power. This is the first
demonstration, to our knowledge, that oscillations in the alpha band are
implicated in the gating of information from the visual cortex to the ventral
stream, as reflected in the representationally specific BOLD signal. This link
of sensory alpha to downstream activity provides a neurophysiological substrate
for the mechanism of selective attention during stimulus processing, which not
only boosts the attended information but also suppresses distraction. Although
previous studies have shown a relation between the BOLD signal from the dorsal
attention network and the alpha band at rest, we demonstrate such a relation
during a visuospatial task, indicating that the dorsal attention network
exercises top-down control of visual alpha activity.}

activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a measure of the
stimulus-driven neural response, we examined whether the amplitude and phase of
occipital alpha oscillations at the onset of a brief visual stimulus affects
the amplitude of the visually evoked fMRI response. When accounting for
intrinsic coupling of alpha amplitude and occipital fMRI signal by modeling and
subtracting pseudo-trials, no significant effect of prestimulus alpha amplitude
on the evoked fMRI response could be demonstrated. Regarding the effect of
alpha phase, we found that stimuli arriving at the peak of the alpha cycle
yielded a lower blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI response in early
visual cortex (V1/V2) than stimuli presented at the trough of the cycle. Our
results therefore show that phase of occipital alpha oscillations impacts the
overall strength of a visually evoked response, as indexed by the BOLD signal.
This observation complements existing evidence that alpha oscillations reflect
periodic variations in cortical excitability and suggests that the phase of
oscillations in postsynaptic potentials can serve as a mechanism of gain
control for incoming neural activity. Finally, our findings provide a putative
neural basis for observations of alpha phase dependence of visual perceptual
performance.}

synchronized neuronal activity merely represents an epiphenomenon or whether it
is causally involved in the selective gating of information. Here, we combined
bilateral high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS)
at 40 Hz with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to study
immediate electrophysiological effects during the selective entrainment of
oscillatory gamma-band signatures. We found that interhemispheric functional
connectivity was modulated in a predictable, phase-specific way: In-phase
stimulation enhanced synchronization, anti-phase stimulation impaired
functional coupling. Perceptual correlates of these connectivity changes were
found in an ambiguous motion task, which strongly support the functional
relevance of long-range neuronal coupling. Additionally, our results revealed a
decrease in oscillatory alpha power in response to the entrainment of gamma
band signatures. This finding provides causal evidence for the antagonistic
role of alpha and gamma oscillations in the parieto-occipital cortex and
confirms that the observed gamma band modulations were physiological in nature.
Our results demonstrate that synchronized cortical network activity across
several spatiotemporal scales is essential for conscious perception and
cognition.}

Interestingly, oscillatory patterns are also observed in behaviour, such as in
visual performance measures after the presentation of a brief sensory event in
the visual or another modality. These oscillations in visual performance cycle
at the typical frequencies of brain rhythms, suggesting that perception may be
closely linked to brain oscillations. We here investigated this link for a
prominent rhythm of the visual system (the alpha-rhythm, 8–12 Hz) by applying
rhythmic visual stimulation at alpha-frequency (10.6 Hz), known to lead to a
resonance response in visual areas, and testing its effects on subsequent
visual target discrimination. Our data show that rhythmic visual stimulation at
10.6 Hz: 1) has specific behavioral consequences, relative to stimulation at
control frequencies (3.9 Hz, 7.1 Hz, 14.2 Hz), and 2) leads to alpha-band
oscillations in visual performance measures, that 3) correlate in precise
frequency across individuals with resting alpha-rhythms recorded over
parieto-occipital areas. The most parsimonious explanation for these three
findings is entrainment (phase-locking) of ongoing perceptually relevant
alpha-band brain oscillations by rhythmic sensory events. These findings are in
line with occipital alpha-oscillations underlying periodicity in visual
performance, and suggest that rhythmic stimulation at frequencies of intrinsic
brain-rhythms can be used to reveal influences of these rhythms on task
performance to study their functional roles.}

performance fluctuated rhythmically. When the flash was presented in the right

cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in
continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local

assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the
Kullback–Leibler distance—a function that is used to infer the distance between
two distributions—and calculates how much an empirical amplitude
distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform
distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for
assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other
CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is
especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects
related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these
analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the
measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from
freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions

This study examined the influence of pre-stimulus alpha phase and attention on
whether two visual stimuli occurring closely in time were perceived as
simultaneous or asynchronous. The results demonstrated that certain phases of
alpha in the period immediately preceding stimulus onset were associated with a
higher proportion of stimuli judged to be asynchronous. Furthermore, this
effect was shown to occur independently of both visuo-spatial attention and
alpha amplitude. The findings are compatible with proposals that alpha phase
reflects cyclic shifts in neuronal excitability. Importantly, however, the
results further suggest that fluctuations in neuronal excitability can create a
periodicity in neuronal transfer that can have functional consequences that are
decoupled from changes in alpha amplitude. This study therefore provides
evidence that perceptual processes fluctuate periodically although it remains
uncertain whether this implies the discrete temporal framing of perception.

  note={
Figure 1 shows the experiment design. A cue indicated where a subsequent
stimuli would appear (left or right). The stimuli consisted on two lateralized
dots that could appear simulutaneously or lagged. They measured the effect of
simultaneity only on a left parieto-occipital cluster where alpha amplitude was
modulated by attention. Figure 2a shows the scalp map of these electrodes and
Figure 2b shows  the difference in phase between asynchronous and synchronous
perceptions (to asynchronous stimuli). In the 50~ms before stimuli presentation
the phase of asynchronously and synchronously reported stimuli are separated by
almost 90 degrees. Figure 3 shows the phase distribution at the time of stimuli
onset across participants. The authors use an ANOVA to show that the phase
hemisphere is related to the proportion of asynchronously reported stimuli.
However, and ANOVA may not be adequate to test differences in proportions. At
least the authors should have provided evidence that the ANOVA analysis was
adequate (normality of residuals, homegeity of variance). Figure 4 shows that
the effect was not present in single electrodes for subject averaged data.
Figure 5 shows that the effect was not present on non-alpha frequency bands.
%
Excellent references and discussion. However, I feel the main result in Figure
3 is invalid. The phase distributions do not look very different. Specifically
for the simultaneous group there does not seem to be phase concentration (ITC
would definitively be non-significant). And an ANOVA on proportion data may not
be adequate. Moreover, I don't like that they average data across subjects and
electrodes, and that they perform the analsys at the electrode level.

Temporal expectations enhance neural encoding precision, reflected in
optimized alignment of slow neural oscillatory phase, and facilitate
subsequent stimulus processing. If an event's exact occurrence time is
unknown, temporal expectations arise solely from the passage of time. Here, we
show that this specific type of temporal expectation is also reflected in
neural phase organization. While undergoing magnetoencephalography,
participants performed an auditory-delayed matching-to-sample task with two
syllables (S1, S2). Critically, S1-onset time varied in the 0.6-1.8~s (i.e.,
0.6-1.7 Hz) range. Increasing S1-onset times led to increased slow-delta
(0.6-0.9 Hz) phase coherence over right frontotemporal sensors during S1
encoding. Moreover, individuals with higher slow-delta coherence showed
decreased alpha power (8-13 Hz) during subsequent memory retention. In sum,
temporal expectations based on the passage of time optimize the precise
alignment of neural oscillatory phase with an expected stimulus.
},
   note={

Excellent connection with literature. Most studies relating brain rhythms to
attention and expectation use fixed foreperiod and stimuli are
presented at perceptual threshold. This study used a variable foreperiod and
stimuli were presented well above threshold. The authors show a significant
positive correlation between foreperiod and slow-delta ITPC (Fig 2D) and a
negative correlation between foreperiod and alpha power (Fig 3A). Thus,
increased expectation in larger foreperiods increases ITPC during stimulus
encodings (early times) which decreases cognitive load (lower alpha power)
during memory retention (later times).

Fig 1a illustrates the timing of the experiment. A cue indicated the range of
foreperiod (early, late, or neutral). Cues were constant in blocks
of trials. Then a foreperiod was introduced lasting between 0.6 and 1.8
seconds. Next S1 was presented. Finally S2 appeared. Subjects had to tell if
the consonant in S1 was the same as in S2. Fig 1b plots the hazard function of
the experiment.

The authors decided to investigate the relation between delta ITCP and
foreperiods and between alpha power and foreperiod. They perform a two-level
analysis. In the first level the correlate foreperiod with rhythmic measures
(delta ITCP, evoked power, total power, alpha power) on each
time-frequency-channel bin. On the second level the correlation coefficients
from the first level analysis were tested on the group level against zero
using cluster-based permutation tests.

For correlation coefficients with delta phase a significant positive cluster
was found: -0.5 to 0.46 s, right fronto-central electrodes, 0.6 to 0.9 Hz
(bottom panel Fig 2a).

The upper panel in Fig 2a shows the correlation coefficient (beta value)
between foreperiod ant ITPC values at different frequencies, averaged across
participants, and averaged across chanels in the significant delta phase
positive cluster illustrated in the lower panel. Significant correlations were
obtained in the (0.6)-(0.9) Hz and (-0.5)-(0.48) sec. Figs 2b and 2c are as
Fig 2a but for evoked power and total power (they are not very informative).
The gray lines in Fig 2D show correlations between foreperiod and delta ITCP
for different subjects. The black line shows the average of the grey lines.
These lines demonstrate that ITCP increases with forperiod.

For correlation coefficients with alpha power a significant negative cluster
was found: 1.12 to 1.92 s (much later than the positive delta cluster, as in
YamagishiEtAl08), centro-parietal electrodes, 8 to 13 Hz (right panel Fig 3a).

The left panel in Fig 3A shows the negative correlation between alpha power
and foreperiod. The fact that delta ITCP is positively correlated 
and alpha power is negatively correlated 
with foreperiod suggest that delta ITCP and alpha power are correlated with
each other. Fig 3B shows that the alpha power and delta ITCP of the seven
foreperiod bins (averaged across participants) is negatively correlated.
Figure 3B shows that the alpha power and delta ITCP of of the ten
participantes (averaged across foreperiods) is also negatively correlated.

In sum the authors showed that increased temporal expectation, in variable
foreperiod experiments with stimuli well above threshold, yield larger ITPC at
the time of stimuli encoding and lower alpha power at the time of memory
retention. Importantly, with supra-threshold stimulation no effect no
behavioral or neurophysiological effects of the warning signal were detected.

High gamma power has been related to increased memory load. Thus the decreased
alpha power with increased expectation (increased foreperiod duration)
indicates a decrease in memory load with increased expectation.

When the authors recomputed the correlation between delta ITPC and alpha power
in the left panel of Fig 3B after regressing out the foreperiod, they found no
significant association. This shows that the foreperiod modulates both the
earlier increase in ITPC and the later decrease in alpha power. It represents
evidence that temporal expectation benefit memory retention by optimized
neural phase organization at the time of stimulus encoding.

  abstract={

Temporal cues can be used to selectively attend to relevant information during
abundant sensory stimulation. However, such cues differ vastly in the accuracy
of their temporal estimates, ranging from very predictable to very
unpredictable. When cues are strongly predictable, attention may facilitate
selective processing by aligning relevant incoming information to high
neuronal excitability phases of ongoing low-frequency oscillations. However,
top-down effects on ongoing oscillations when temporal cues have some
predictability, but also contain temporal uncertainties, are unknown. Here, we
experimentally created such a situation of mixed predictability and
uncertainty: A target could occur within a limited time window after cue but
was always unpredictable in exact timing. Crucially to assess top-down effects
in such a mixed situation, we manipulated target probability. High target
likelihood, compared with low likelihood, enhanced delta oscillations more
strongly as measured by evoked power and intertrial coherence. Moreover, delta
phase modulated detection rates for probable targets. The delta frequency
range corresponds with half-a-period to the target occurrence window and
therefore suggests that low-frequency phase reset is engaged to produce a long
window of high excitability when event timing is uncertain within a restricted
temporal window.

This article is similar to wislchEtAl15 in that it uses broadly distributed
foreperiod duration. But differently from wilschEtAl15 stimuli were shown at
perceptual threshold. It shows effect of stimuli probability on alpha and
delta evoked power, total power, and ITC. In addition is shows significant
differences in delta phases between hits and misses only in the
high-probability condition. They analyzed neural activity between 0.1 and
0.4~seconds evoked by the visual cue.

Fig 1 shows the stimuli. Individual detection threshold were determined. A
trial consisted of the presentation of a visual circle for 75ms (the color of
the circle indicated if the following sound would be presented with a low
(50\%) or high (80\%) probability) followed or not by the presentation of a
low-intensity sound. The sound was presented in the interval 0-450~ms or
1-1.5sec after the circle. The task of the subject was to report in a 1-4
scale if they have heard the sound.

Fig 2 shows the behavioral results indicating that there existed a foreperiod
effect on reaction times (although I don't understand the sensitivity/bias
plots).

Fig 3a shows an ERP analysis that failed to identify significant differences
between the low- (LP) and high-probability (H) conditions. Fig 3b and 3c show
a larger evoked power during the HP condition in the delta and alpha ranges.

Fig 4a shows that total power was larger in the alpha range for the high-
than the low-probability condition. Fig 4b shows a larger ITC in the high-
than in the low-probability condition in two subranges of alpha and in delta.

Fig 5 plots the phases for hits and misses in the low- and high-probability
conditions. In the high-probability but not in the low-probability condition
the mean phase for hits was different from that for misses.

  abstract={

The perception of near-threshold visual stimuli has been shown to depend in
part on the phase (i.e., time in the cycle) of ongoing alpha (8–13 Hz)
oscillations in the visual cortex relative to the onset of that stimulus.
However, it is currently unknown whether the phase of the ongoing alpha
activity can be manipulated by top–down factors such as attention or
expectancy. Using three variants of a cross-modal attention paradigm with
constant predictable stimulus onsets, we examined if cues signaling to attend
to either the visual or the auditory domain influenced the phase of alpha
oscillations in the associated sensory cortices. Importantly, intermixed in
all three experiments, we included trials without a target to estimate the
phase at target presentation without contamination from the early evoked
responses. For these blank trials, at the time of expected target and
distractor onset, we examined (1) the degree of the uniformity in phase angles
across trials, (2) differences in phase angle uniformity compared with a
pretarget baseline, and (3) phase angle differences between visual and
auditory target conditions. Across all three experiments, we found that,
although the cues induced a modulation in alpha power in occipital electrodes,
neither the visual condition nor the auditory cue condition induced any
significant phase-locking across trials during expected target or distractor
presentation. These results suggest that, although alpha power can be
modulated by top–down factors such as attention and expectation, the phase of
the ongoing alpha oscillation is not under such control.

A fixed audio-visual foreperiod experiment is used, where subjects had to
orient their attention to the visual or auditory moadlity in a trial-by-trial
basis, detect the orientation of a target grating or the pich of a target
sound, and where in some trials (blanck trials) targets were not presented.
The authors investigated the existence of phase modulations in blanck trials,
without sensory evoked responses, but found none. They conclude that
modulations of phase are not a top-down phenomenon.

I don't agree with the aim of the authors of removing stimulus-evoked
activity to study top-down effects, as this activity could carry substantial
information about top-down effects. Maybe top-down effects are more
clearly seen in stimulus-related modulations of oscillatory activity and
removing stimulus-evoked activity would cover these modulations.

In our avshift paper we see clear modulations of the new foreperiod effect on
ITPC by attention, a top-down effect, in a task that also continuosly requires
shifts in attention.

They only show EEG results averaged across subjects and no correlation between
phase and behavior.

In Experiment 1 targets and distractors were resented at different times, in
experiment 2 they were presented at the same time, and in experiment 3 only
targets from a single modality were presented.

Fig 1 shows the experiment design. The stimuli was not optimized to subjects'
perceptual abilities.

Fig 2 shows modulations of alpha. The attentional cue induced
modality-specific modulations of alpha power in anticipation of target
presentation. Alpha power was larger over occipital brain regions before the
presentation of auditory than visual targets.

Fig 3 shows modulations of ITC by the cue and targets but no modulation in
blank trials. This is the main figure of the article.

Fig 4 shows that a very small number of subjects showed significant ITC across
electrodes.

Fig 5 shows that very few electrodes showed a significant difference between
ITC at the expected target/distractor presentation and ITC at the baseline.

Fig 6 shows that few electrodes showed a significant difference in phase angle
between the visual and auditory modality.

Fig 7 shows scalp maps of significant differences in alpha power at the time
of presentation of targets between visual and auditory targets.

Everyday human behaviour relies on our ability to predict outcomes on the
basis of moment by moment information. Long-range
neural phase synchronization has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which
‘predictions’ can exert an effect on the processing of
incoming sensory events. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we have studied
the relationship between the modulation of phase
synchronization in a cerebral network of areas involved in visual target
processing and the predictability of target occurrence. Our
results reveal a striking increase in the modulation of phase synchronization
associated with an increased probability of target
occurrence. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that
long-range phase synchronization plays a critical functional
role in humans’ ability to effectively employ predictive heuristics.

Because of attentional limitations, the human visual system can process for
awareness and response only a fraction of the input received. Lesion and
functional imaging studies have identified frontal, temporal, and parietal
areas as playing a major role in the attentional control of visual processing,
but very little is known about how these areas interact to form a dynamic
attentional network. We hypothesized that the network communicates by means of
neural phase synchronization, and we used magnetoencephalography to study
transient long-range interarea phase coupling in a well studied attentionally
taxing dual-target task (attentional blink). Our results reveal that
communication within the fronto-parieto-temporal attentional network proceeds
via transient long-range phase synchronization in the beta band. Changes in
synchronization reflect changes in the attentional demands of the task and are
directly related to behavioral performance. Thus, we show how attentional
limitations arise from the way in which the subsystems of the attentional
network interact.

The oscillatory phase-resetting model predicts that event-related potential

different frequencies. We investigate this question in a memory task in which
human subjects had to retrieve a verbal label in response to the presentation

theta, alpha and beta range undergo a significant phase resetting and (ii)
become synchronized in absolute phase during small time windows that (iii)
coincide with the latencies of the P1–N1 complex. Our conclusion is that the
latencies of ERP components can be predicted at least in part by phase
synchronization between frequencies.

Executive response functions can be affected by preceding events, even if they
are no longer associated with the current task at hand. For example, studies
utilizing the stop signal task have reported slower response times to “GO”
stimuli when the preceding trial involved the presentation of a “STOP” signal.
However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this behavioral after-effect are
unclear. To address this, behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures
were examined in 18 young adults (18–30 years) on “GO” trials following a
previously “Successful Inhibition” trial (pSI), a previously “Failed
Inhibition” trial (pFI), and a previous “GO” trial (pGO). Like previous
research, slower response times were observed during both pSI and pFI trials
(i.e., “GO” trials that were preceded by a successful and unsuccessful
inhibition trial, respectively) compared to pGO trials (i.e., “GO” trials that
were preceded by another “GO” trial).  Interestingly, response time slowing
was greater during pSI trials compared to pFI trials, suggesting executive
control is influenced by both task set switching and persisting motor
inhibition processes.  Follow-up behavioral analyses indicated that these
effects resulted from between-trial control adjustments rather than repetition
priming effects. Analyses of inter-electrode coherence (IEC) and inter-trial
coherence (ITC) indicated that both pSI and pFI trials showed greater phase
synchrony during the inter-trial interval compared to pGO trials. Unlike the
IEC findings, differential ITC was present within the beta and alpha frequency
bands in line with the observed behavior (pSI>pFI>pGO), suggestive of more
consistent phase synchrony involving motor inhibition processes during the ITI
at a regional level. These findings suggest that between-trial control
adjustments involved with task-set switching and motor inhibition processes
influence subsequent performance, providing new insights into the dynamic
nature of executive control
