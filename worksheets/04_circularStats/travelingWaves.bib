  abstract={

During sleep, the thalamus generates a characteristic pattern of transient, 11-15 Hz sleep spindle oscillations, which synchronize the cortex through large-scale thalamocortical loops. Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.

  note={

The authors find rotating and expanding traveling waves (TWs) in human sleep
spindles, and demonstrate that these waves repeat with large precsion across
stage 2 of sleep. They argue that TWs could help LTP in memory
consolidation.  The article describes in quite a lot of detail the methodology
developed by Lylle for the detection of TWs. I like that they use
the unit of an oscillatory cycle to quantify TWs (e.g., compare
their repeatability). It is useful the method proposed to compare the
similarity between TWs (i.e., use of circular-circular correlation
coefficients), although I do not yes understand it well.

Figure~1 illustrates sleep spindles, TWs, their mean velocities,
and their mean flow field.

Video~1 illustrates a TW.

Figure~2 argues that due to long axonal delays if spindles were perfectly
synchronized LTP (long-term potentiation) would not be possible, and instead
lead to LTD (long-term depression), and that TWs could help solve this problem. Neat argument.

Video~2 illustrates the repeatability of the TWs.

Figure~3a shows that rotating TWs are more repeatable than other types of TWs.
They compare similarity among TWs in cycles of oscillations using a
circular-circular correlation coefficient.

Figure~3b shows that TWs with stronger rotation appearance are more repeatable
than TWs with wekaer rotation appearance.

Figure~4a shows that larger spindle amplitude is associated with larger
high-gamma power (HGP), and Figure~4B demonstrates phase-amplitude coupling
between spindle phase and high-gamma modulation ration (power?), and this
coupling is stronger for larger spindles.

Figure~4c illustrates that the more similar is a given oscillatory cycle with
the next one, the larger is the number of repeats that are observed of the
given oscillatory pattern in a 2.5~hours period of sleep. This figure plots the
number of strong repeats (i.e. the number of oscillatory cycles with a
similarity index greater than 0.7 wrt a given oscillatory cycle, x-axis) as a
function of the similarity between a given and the next oscillatory cycle.
